                <p>
                  Hi there, I'm Hawk. Im a front-end web developer who's trying
                  to fill up the puzzle of coding knowledge, piece by piece,
                  slow but steady.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I first knew about web programming is 5 years ago at my
                  university as a requirement for my Information System major.
                  However, I haven't had much chance practicing it until the
                  time I & my friend started building up a website for our
                  start-up project. The project didn't go well; However, it did
                  light up my inner fire, my inspiration about development. Ever
                  since, I started my web development journey by swimming into
                  the ocean of coding knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm seeking an opportunity to work and contribute my knowledge
                  in creating extraordinary experience for company’s technical
                  audience. I know it's hard at first but I strongly believe
                  that I could finally make it by continuously stacking up my
                  knowledge as well as real-life projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you're not satisfied with my projects at first, please give
                  me another chance to come back after couple days for my new
                  coming projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm a web developer. I build up things, not design it. I do
                  not take any credits for the designs here. I gather most of
                  these designs by surfing around the net then build up a new
                  one from scratch , based on my knowledge and techs.
                </p>
